After completing the first course which is four weeks long, I would rate myself pretty low because some things I am still confused about. I would probably ask more questions and try to do more practice on learning this code. I am excited to continue with this course and hope I do better in the web development course. The were squirrel example used objects and arrays to make the example effective. He used variables and values in this example to distinguish between them. He makes a variable with journal and gives it a bunch of different events in an array. We know this is an array since it uses square brackets. For example, curly brackets are objects and each event that is listed is in square brackets, so it is an array.  With the values all it does is call on the name of the array or object it wants but most of the time it is an array. Finally, the author decided to use more arrays because it is easier to combine more values of numbers and strings in an array than it is to combine them in an object. With the same reasoning my program with the choose your own adventure game could use an array when deciding what choice to make instead of doing 3+ if choice was this you could do one statement that lists the choices and outputs the choice you made with the correct statement that comes next.
