After the two weeks I think the biggest challenge for me is understanding for loops or any other loops. I have always struggled with understanding for loops and other loops. I think I will overcome it by just doing a bunch of different for loops and other loops and trying to understand how they work and what they do in the program. There are 3 different types of loops which are for loops, while loops and do-while loops. For the do-while loops they are when you do a loop that does something once and if it is true it will continue to execute the loop but if it turns out to be false it stops the loop and continues the code below the loop. For the for loops it makes a loop that executes something over and over again till you need to break out. Finally, a while loop executes something for ever until the given statement is false. When your coding it is better to write in pseudocode to tell the process of your steps as to how you run the program. It is good to do this because if you do not know how to write the code this can help you get started. It is also good to tell the person who reads the code your thinking process and the steps in a language they understand and not just in code. Writing in pseudocode will help in the future if you forget what a certain part of the program does or how you wrote a certain part of the code to copy it. So thatâ€™s why pseudocode is really important on people who are just beginning in the code world.
