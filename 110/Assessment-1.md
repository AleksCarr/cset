I think the reason HTML is an open standard and not owned by a specific person or company is because HTML is used to make basically every webpage out there. So if it was owned by a specific person or company you would have to go through them to use it if you wanted to create a webpage and that is not what the creator of HTML wanted they wanted it to be used by anyone at anytime. That is why it is an open standard and not owned by a specific person or company. HTML elements are a combination of both tags and content. With elements it starts with a start tag then adds some content and ends with an end tag. While a HTML tag is what you are doing with the content. For example you can use <p> for a paragraph or <h1> for a heading so a tag is what is applying to the content and the element is the overall whole line. You used two quotes one from yoda which said, the greatest teacher, failure is. Which if you have ever watched star wars you know yoda says the beginiing of the sentence at the end. So he is saying failure is the greatest teacher. This quote relates to HTML because that is a synatically error which means you haven't followed the rules of the language. The other quote he used was by Noam Chomsky which says Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. This relates to HTML because it is a sematical error which means you have't really communicated your meaning what you mean you just wrote it down.
