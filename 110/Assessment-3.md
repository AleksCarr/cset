The tools and and techniques for web development have changed over the years but personally I have been keeping them in a notebook so whenever I get stuck I can just look into there and find what ever I need to solve the certain problem that I am having. I think you can look at home-brew and see what has changed or was added. Some limitations for using floats is you can't center an element vertically. You also can't make sibling elements the same height and width, and finally you can't make multiple columns of similar height regardless of their content. So all of this means that the height and width have to be different with floats or it won't work. Flex is an agnostic language and has two axes called main and cross. A property of flex that shows this is justify-content it has couple of elements which are flex-start, flex-end, space-around, space-between, and space-evenly. This justify-content aligns items on the main axis and moves it around as to what element you have decided to choose. It can also change based on what direction you choose to go at it from. If from reverse then everything will be ordered in reverse.
