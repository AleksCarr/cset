My favorite CSS property so far is background-color. I like this one the most because it is used to well like is called make the color of the background which is the most important part of the html file to make it more colorful. The units/values it takes is literally a single color. You can use the single word for the color, rgb value that takes three numbers up to 255 and the hex code which is a combination of six letters and numbers with the number sign in the beginning. If I am making a menu for different food option, I would use the element.class selector which picks all the elements in the specified class. So, if they picked vegetarian, they would show all the vegetarian options and same with if they picked spicy you will show all spicy. Finally, if you pick gluten-free show all gluten-free options. With specificity that rule states that it picks the property and picks the most relevant element and applies that element to it. With the inheritance rule it does not make you apply every font size, family etc. That means every element starts out with a basic font family and size and do not have to specify everything. Finally, with cascade it tells the HTML what it should look like and how the layout should look when you go to the actual webpage. So the difference between them is cascade is how it will look, inheritance makes it so you donâ€™t have to specify and specificity is where it applies a element to a property.
