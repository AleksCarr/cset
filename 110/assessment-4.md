When we learned web development we also learned all of the non-standard aspects because some other platform specific user interfaces have different rules. For example they could use some non-standard aspects as well as some outdated aspects. So it is better to learn these just in case you need to use them. The two examples of media queries are if you use the @media screen and (max-width whatever px) and @media screen and (min-width: whatever px). The user agent will decide which one to use based on whatever size of the screen that you are using and show that layout as you would like it. For example in the project code we had to make it so it showed different stuff if on a smaller screen. Like removing images or rearranging the text so it is centered. I used 400 px for max width for an phone and for min width used 401 for anything higher than 401 pixels. We use breakpoints to define what we want the layout of the page to be. It can be defined by different device sizes. Like for example you can use percent for a clearer difference. Also could use pixels for a bigger number but less clear. I think it is better to use the standard device sizes because for me that is what I am used to and switching it up will make it more confusing and won't get what you want out of you page as clearly as you imagine what it should be.
