In the next few weeks we will be learning how to work on projects like the dom-adventure-game and how professional developers work on larger projects like that one. I am looking forward to how they use their time wisely and how long they spend coding each day on a certain project. Event bubbling is when the event triggers the closest element and then sequentially goes from closest to most out.
For example if something was like
<div class='whatever'>
  <div class='what'>
    <p>Hello></p>
  </div>
</div>    This is a nested element and with bubbling it will start with the first div then go to next div then the p and so on but with propagation it will keep track of everything and fire all at once. We learned of addEventListener which listens for this event and creates a function for that event. For example you could do a a keypress that when you call it whatever key/arrow you specified it will output what you want it to do. You could have it turn a different color or other things. Finally another thing you could do is making a input value that asks for an input and outputs whatever you want.
