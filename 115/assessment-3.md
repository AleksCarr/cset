We just learned how different ways to work on projects with a large team or multiple people. We haven't done anything like that in this class but if we are going to do this the most difficult thing that can go with this is trying to push things and make pull requests also what would happen if someone do two pull requests that are identical that might become a problem also. The remote is where the code you made and pushed that is where it is stored for us the remote is our own Github accounts. A branch is getting there remote and creating it on our local device which then makes a branch and can work on the code and it won't mess up what they already wrote. When you want to be done and add changes to there original code you push it to your own remote and can make a pull request and they can either merge your pull request or not. There are different git workflows we have worked with which are centralized, Feature Branch, Git Flow and Forking for most of our projects what we would use is Forking. We use Forking because when we start a project we go to the original repo and fork from that and then clone the url to get it into our local atom there we modify the code and then when done we can commit and push to your own remote. We have also used centralized because like I said you have to clone the url and that is what centralized encompasses.
