We have done 11 other assessments which usually involve 3-4 questions that involve what we did that week. In a job interview I would like to say I feel comfortable answering these questions it is mainly due to the fact that I know most of the stuff that the assessments talked about. They have helped better than regular quizzes and tests. We learned some about client side tooling but the tool that I think would be most useful to me is either babel or post css. Babel lets you write javascript using the new javascript and converts it to old javascript. Post css is same as Babel but instead of javascript it involves css. We learned two different styles of project methodologies which are waterfall and agile. For waterfall it goes in a waterfall notion so it starts with Requirements then goes to design then to implementation then to testing and finally maintenance. You can't go from one stage until you complete the next. For out tic tac toe we could use waterfall by listing what we need then designing the webpage then implementing the features then testing out the game and then doing any bug fixes. While agile workflow is when you work as one team and in stort iterations to deliver something or progress each time you work. You focus on the requirements and then bug fix when needed.We could use agile for tic tac toe by working together on a certain aspect and when done with it we are done for the day.
